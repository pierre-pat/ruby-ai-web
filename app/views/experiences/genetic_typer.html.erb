<h1>Genetic Typer</h1>
<p>Genetic algorithm are basically a way to evolve an algorithm through iterations.
The algorithm is based on 4 steps:
- Calculate the fitness of each "individual"
- Create a mating pool accordingly
- Breed
- Mutate

The following example is based on an example from <a href="http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/">Nature Of Code</a>. All credits are given there.

By tweaking the values, you should be able to test and see what is a good deal between the size of the population/number of generations/mutation rate.</p>
